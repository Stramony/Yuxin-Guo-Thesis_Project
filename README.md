# Yuxin-Guo-Thesis_Project

This thesis project is created by Yuxin Guo, student ID is 23009014

Due to the large amount of data used in this project and the complexity of the model, a GPU is required. Therefore, Kaggle’s GPU T4*2 was borrowed to ensure the operation and training of the project. All code is completed in Kaggle, so it can only be run in the Kaggle environment and cannot be run locally.

This trained model was originally in the roberta_saved_model folder. Since my trained sentiment classification model was too big, I uploaded the RoBERTa model to Google drive with the link：https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qgSaqUgZ6d74v99ELrv4Rv5FiFSylX8i/view?usp=drive_link. This link can download model, and the code can use this model.
